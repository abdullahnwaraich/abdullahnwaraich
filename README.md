## Summary

Recent PhD graduate in Electrical Engineering with a strong foundation in statistical methodologies, high-dimensional statistics, and dynamical systems. I am passionate about predictive modeling and estimation, with specific expertise in developing and applying machine learning algorithms for statistical arbitrage in finance.

## Predictive Modelling for Statistical Arbitrage (May 2024 - Present)

- Developed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to predict weekly stock price direction and a dynamic programming-based random trading strategy to maximize profit without initial capital under constrained trading rules.
- The trading algorithm demonstrated robust performance across 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, with substantial average profits and a low loss rate.

**Technologies Used**: Python, pandas, jajapy, stormpy

## Invited Talks in Dynamics and Probability

- **Bloomberg Quant (BBQ) Seminar Series (May 2024)**: Concentration of measure phenomenon for high-dimensional time series.
- **Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference (June 2023)**: Lyapunov stability, transportation inequalities, and sampling.

## Computer Skills

- **Languages**: Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, PyMC), C++, Matlab.
- **Expertise**: Predictive Modeling, Statistical Arbitrage, Machine Learning Algorithms, High-Dimensional Data Analysis, and Dynamical Systems.

## Research Experience

- **Ph.D. Dissertation**: 
  - Developed a quantitative handle on eigenvalue statistics of the sample covariance matrix for time realizations of high-dimensional Gaussian auto-regressive models.
  - Demonstrated that performance of OLS estimator on Markovian data is dictated by eigenvalue distribution, with significant implications for financial modeling.
  - Potential application to financial data, specifically in analyzing daily returns on individual stocks within the S&P 500.
