## Summary

Recent PhD graduate in Electrical Engineering from Duke University, with a strong foundation in statistical methodologies, high-dimensional statistics, and dynamical systems. I am passionate about predictive modeling and estimation, with specific expertise in developing and applying machine learning algorithms for statistical arbitrage in finance.

## Predictive Modelling for Statistical Arbitrage (May 2024 - Present)

## Invited Talks in Dynamics and Probability

- **Bloomberg Quant (BBQ) Seminar Series (May 2024)**: Concentration of measure phenomenon for high-dimensional time series.
- **Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference (June 2023)**: Lyapunov stability, transportation inequalities, and sampling.

## Computer Skills

- **Languages**: Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, PyMC), C++, Matlab.
- **Expertise**: Predictive Modeling, Statistical Arbitrage, Machine Learning Algorithms, High-Dimensional Data Analysis, and Dynamical Systems.

## Selected Publications

- **Spectral Statistics of the Sample Covariance Matrix for High Dimensional Linear Gaussians** (with M. Pajic)
- **Concentration Phenomenon for Random Dynamical Systems: An Operator Theoretic Approach** (Learning for Dynamics and Control Conference, 2023)
- **From Spectral Theorem to Statistical Independence with Applications to System Identification** (with A. Khazraei and M. Pajic)
- **Transportation-Inequalities, Lyapunov Stability and Sampling for Dynamical Systems on Continuous State Space** (with M. Pajic, Learning for Dynamics and Control Conference, 2023)

## Research Experience

- **Ph.D. Dissertation**: 
  - Developed a quantitative handle on eigenvalue statistics of the sample covariance matrix for time realizations of high-dimensional Gaussian auto-regressive models.
  - Demonstrated that performance of OLS estimator on Markovian data is dictated by eigenvalue distribution, with significant implications for financial modeling.
